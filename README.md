# DEEP-CORE-cazyme-analysis
Analysis of short metagenomic sequencing reads for carbohydrate utilization

## First, we need to create an environment that contains all of the correct versions of the software that we want to use. We will use a conda environment to accomplish this. Here is the best way to get conda installed in your home environment.

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
    bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3/
    source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
    conda update -n base -c defaults conda
    
## Now we need to install a version of hmmer.  Use the hmmer-environment.yml file contained in this repository to run the following command. As a note.. This file was created from Joe's home directory on discovery using the first two lines below

#### For Joe

    conda activate hmmer
    conda env export > hmmer-environment.yml

#### For User

    conda env create -f hmmer-environment.yml
